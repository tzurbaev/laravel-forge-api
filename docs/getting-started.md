# Requirements

- PHP 7.2+;
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org);
- Laravel Forge API token ([create new token](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile));

# Dependencies

This package depends on `guzzlehttp/guzzle ~6.0`. If you're using older version of Guzzle, make sure to update your code to avoid version conflicts.

# Installation

The recommended way to install the SDK is with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```sh
composer require tzurbaev/laravel-forge-api ^1.5
```

Alternatively, you can specify the SDK as a dependency in your project's existing composer.json file:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "tzurbaev/laravel-forge-api": "^1.5"
  }
}
```

# Laravel Integration

If you're running Laravel 5.5+ and using version 1.5.1+ of this package, you can simply install this package via Composer and everything else will be done via Laravel's Package Discovery feature.

## Only for Laravel < 5.5 && laravel-forge-api < 1.5.1
- Add `Laravel\Forge\Laravel\ForgeServiceProvider` to your providers list (`config/app.php`);

## All Laravel versions:
1. Run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Forge\Laravel\ForgeServiceProvider"` command;
1. Edit `config/forge.php` configuration file or add token to `FORGE_TOKEN` environment variable (`.env` file);

Now you should be able to run `php artisan forge:credentials` command to list your Forge credentials and `php artisan forge:servers` to list, create and delete servers.

Since package's Service Provider bootstraps Forge class with your credentials, you can simply inject `Laravel\Forge\Forge` class via Laravel's Dependency Injection:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Laravel\Forge\Forge;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ForgeController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request, Forge $forge)
    {
        // $forge is ready to use.
    }

    public function update(Request $request)
    {
        $forge = app(Forge::class);

        // $forge is ready to use.
    }
}
```

Or use facade:


```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Forge;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ForgeController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $server = Forge::get($request->input('server_id'));
    }
}
```
